# Project Overview
* FEED READER TESTING

* In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
* I've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)
* Testing is done on initial resources as well as new test suites are also written.
* It finishes in 6.058s approx.


# How to open and run the app?
* Download the .zip folder and extract it using WinRar or any other application that unzips the zipped folder.
* Right-click on the index.html file and select 'open with' option followed by choosing your choice of web-browser.
* View the Udacity Feeds in the web-browser and scroll down to see Jasmine's Spec Runner results.
* No. of specs and failures appear on the page telling you about the tests that the FEEDs is put through and its results.
